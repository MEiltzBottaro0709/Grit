**Grit** is a helper library for the **git** version control system

The helper modules are called **pebbles** and can be executed this way

	$ grit <pebble> <pebble-args>
	
For instance the command
	
	$ grit revnum HEAD
	
would output the svn-like revision number for the provided commit (HEAD can be replaced with any commit hash)
